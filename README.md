### **Usage**

> **🚨 Warning:**
> This script installs and removes packages, and modifies system configuration files. **Review all commands before running.**

#### **1. Download \& Run**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/actuallyaryaman/Fedora_Setup
cd Fedora_Setup
chmod +x fedora-setup.sh
./fedora-setup.sh
```


### **Notes**

- **Restart your shell after adding aliases:**

```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # For Bash
source ~/.zshrc    # For Zsh
```

- **Package tracking:**
All explicitly installed packages are saved to `pkglist.txt` when you export the package list. Back up this file if you want to restore your package selection later.
- **Battery threshold:**
The battery charge limit feature requires compatible hardware (e.g., ThinkPad, some ASUS laptops) and root privileges.
- **Parallel downloads:**
Enabling parallel downloads can significantly speed up system updates on fast connections.
